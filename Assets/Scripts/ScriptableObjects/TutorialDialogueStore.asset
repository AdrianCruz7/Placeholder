  dialogue:
  - Hello, this is Mr. Syrup from Human Resources. I know you probably know this
    by now, but all you need to do is make the decisions when we prompt you via the
    tablet on your desk there.
  - Depending on what you choose will affect the lives of whoever it concerns, so
    I hope you put each choice you make into a heavy stipulation before clicking
    on the answer you pick.
  - "Remember, it is our goal to keep an eye on our country\u2019s population, as
    national resources are running very thin."
  - "If you make the wrong choice regarding our division\u2019s main goal, then you
    will receive a \u201Ccontrolled shock\u201D to improve your behavior."
  - "Each sequent shock you will receive will increase in voltage so I\u2019m sure
    your body wouldn\u2019t be able to the pain by the third time, and we would have
    to call an ambulance for you."
  - Of course, that would come out of your paycheck so I trust that you will make
    the right call when the time comes.
  - "Alright, I\u2019ll leave you to it then. Remember, all you need to do is pick
    up your tablet to start the day. Good luck."
